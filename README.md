# Chimpanzee Memory Game

## Overview

This project is a simple game inspired by Tetsuro Matsuzawa's experiment on chimpanzee's short-term memory, conducted at Kyoto University. The game is designed to provide an interactive experience that mirrors the cognitive challenges faced by chimpanzees in the experiment. In the experiment chimps memorized the sequence in less than a second and then replicated it successfully with up to 9 symbols, vastly outperforming humans.

## Description

The Chimpanzee Memory Game challenges players to remember and replicate sequences of tiles on the screen. The game presents a sequence of numbers, which the player must memorize. After a brief period, the numbers disappear, and the player is tasked with reproducing the sequence from memory. With each successful replication, the sequence becomes longer, increasing the difficulty and testing the player's memory capabilities.

## Features

- Interactive gameplay simulating the memory task faced by chimpanzees in the experiment.
- Increasing difficulty level as the player successfully replicates sequences.

## How to Play

1. Start the game by running the executable file `Memory-game.exe`. Conversely you can run script `source/main.py` with Python.
2. Memorize the location sequence of numbered tiles.
3. Click on any tile to make numbers disappear.
4. After the numbers disappear, use your mouse to input the replicated sequence of tiles in order.
5. If you fail, just try again!
